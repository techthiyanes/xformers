## Understanding the dimension conventions

Let's start from a classical overview of the Transformer architecture (illustration from Lin et al,, "A Survey of Transformers")

![Transformer architecture](docs/assets/Transformer_arch_Lin_et_al.png)

You should be able to match most of the blocks to parts exposed in `xformers/components`. In particular, the attention is handled through two parts: the `MultiHeadDispatch`, which is shared across most attention mechanisms, and the proper attention (in `xformers/components/attention`) which you can see as being head-ignorant (except for a couple of attention mechanisms).

### Batch dimensions

The dimensions expectations are, throughout the Transformer pipeline:

- inputs:
  - **`[Batch, Sequence]`**
  - (note that a model like ViT would have a different front end which additionally handle the image channels)

- post-encoding:
  - **`[Batch, Sequence, Embedding]`**

  the following sequence repeats for every Transformer layer after the initial encoding:
  - multi-head wrapper:
    - reshapes to **`[Batch * n_heads, Sequence, head_dimension]`**
    - compute per-head attention
    - reshapes outputs back to **`[Batch, Sequence, Embedding]`**
  - FFN:
    - **`[Batch, Sequence, Embedding]`**
    - keeps the same dimensions all along

### Attention masks

1. Sparse attention: In that case, the attention mask is expected to be **`[Sequence, Sequence]`**, no need to expand or repeat it across the batch for instance.

2. Blocksparse attention: two options are equaly valid in that case,  **`[Sequence, Sequence]`** or  **`[Head, Sequence, Sequence]`**. Attention masks can be defined on a per-head basis

The following patterns are for instance possible (from "A survey of Transformers", Lin et al.)

![Attention patterns](docs/assets/attention_mask_examples.png)

Many helpers to generate 2d and 3d patterns are [available](xformers/components/attention/attention_patterns.py), as well as a small tool to get a blocksparse pattern out of an existing per-coeffient mask.

## Sparse Attention

### How to use it ?

There is nothing specific to be done, as long as you are using the normal `scaled_dot_product` attention ! As soon as it is called with a sparse enough mask (`density < 30%`), then the computations will be sparse, thanks to a variant of the [Sputnik](https://github.com/google-research/sputnik) kernels.

```python
import torch
from xformers.components.attention import ScaledDotProduct

attention = ScaledDotProduct().cuda()

# FW a random bunch of data
inputs = torch.rand((16, 1024, 1024), device=torch.device("cuda"))

# Not a very sparse mask to begin with
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()

mask = (torch.rand((1024, 1024)) < 0.9).cuda()
att = attention(q=inputs, k=inputs, v=inputs, mask=mask)

torch.cuda.synchronize()
max_memory = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() // 2 ** 20
print(f"Dense - Peak memory use: {max_memory}MB")

# Now use a very sparse mask and observe that memory use changes
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()

mask = (torch.rand((1024, 1024)) < 0.1).cuda()
att = attention(q=inputs, k=inputs, v=inputs, mask=mask)

torch.cuda.synchronize()
max_memory = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() // 2 ** 20
print(f"Sparse - Peak memory use: {max_memory}MB")
```

You should see something along the lines of:

```bash
Dense - Peak memory use: 501MB
Sparse - Peak memory use: 321MB
```

Note that we did not change anything in the model, the input mask was just sparse enough to trigger the specific CUDA kernels.

### Create complex sparsity patterns with xFormers

This is best presented in an executable notebook, see [Creating complex sparsity patterns with xFormers](docs/source/2d_attention_patterns.ipynb). We can expose a couple of concepts here, though. Attention patterns are expressed over the attention matrix, and they intuitively represent the fact that an element in a sequence is allowed to "look at" another element in another sequence (same sequence in the self-attention case). With this framework, a local attention (an element is only able to look at its neighbors) is simply a diagonal pattern, while an element which can look at the whole sequence has a row+col matching mask. xFormers provide a couple of helpers to generate attention patterns, which can then be combined:

```python
import xformers.components.attention.attention_patterns as AP

# Couple of examples of attention patterns useful for vision
H, W = 20, 30  # assuming a 20 x 30 sequence length

# - axial attention
axial_pattern = AP.axial_2d_pattern(H, W)

# - local attention
loc_2d_dist = AP.local_2d_pattern(H, W, distance=5, p=2.0)  # distance and thresholds are user defined

# - random attention
gaus_2d_dist = AP.local_2d_gausian_distribution(H, W, sigma=2)
sparsity = 0.95
num_non_zeros = int((H * W) ** 2 * (1 - sparsity))
random_gaus_2d_pattern = AP.random_pattern_from_probability_matrix(gaus_2d_dist, num_non_zeros)

# - combining different patterns
combined_mask = axial_pattern | loc_2d_dist | random_gaus_2d_pattern
```

![Axial pattern](docs/assets/axial_pattern.png)
![Local pattern](docs/assets/local_pattern.png)
![Gaussian pattern](docs/assets/gaussian_pattern.png)
![Combined pattern](docs/assets/combined_pattern.png)

### Replace all attentions from an existing ViT model with a sparse equivalent ?

Let's say you're used to working with a given Transformer based model, and want to experiment with one of the attention mechanisms supported by xFormers. We have [notebooks](docs/source/vision_transformers.ipynb) for a more exhaustive take, if this snippet exposes any doubt please check out the notebook to make sure that everything is clear, or just reach out to the authors.

```python
import timm
from timm.models.vision_transformer import VisionTransformer
from xformers.components.attention import ScaledDotProduct
from xformers.components.attention.helpers import TimmAttentionWrapper
img_size = 224
patch_size = 16

# Get a reference ViT model
model = VisionTransformer(img_size=img_size, patch_size=patch_size,
                              embed_dim=96, depth=8, num_heads=8, mlp_ratio=3.,
                              qkv_bias=False, norm_layer=nn.LayerNorm).cuda()


# Define the mask that we want to use
# We suppose in this snipper that you have a precise mask in mind already
# but several helpers and examples are proposed in  `xformers.components.attention.attention_patterns`
my_fancy_mask : torch.Tensor  # This would be for you to define

# Define a recursive monkey patching function
def replace_attn_with_xformers_one(module, att_mask):
    module_output = module
    if isinstance(module, timm.models.vision_transformer.Attention):
        qkv = module.qkv
        dim = qkv.weight.shape[1] * module.num_heads
        # Extra parameters can be exposed in TimmAttentionWrapper, this is a minimal example
        module_output = TimmAttentionWrapper(dim, module.num_heads, attn_mask=att_mask)
    for name, child in module.named_children():
        module_output.add_module(name, replace_attn_with_xformers_one(child, att_mask))
    del module
    return module_output

# Now we can just patch our reference model, and get a sparse-aware variation
model = replace_attn_with_xformers_one(model, mask)
```

Note that in practice exchanging all the attentions with a sparse alternative may not be a good idea, as the attentions closer to the output are not typically exhibiting a clear sparsity pattern. You can alter `replace_attn_with_xformers_one` above, or replace manually the attentions which would like to sparsify, but not all

- on a [SwinTransformers](docs/source/swin_transformers.ipynb)

## BlockSparseAttention

This uses the blocksparse computations which are provided by Triton out of the box. In xFormers, you can use the BlocksSparseAttention,
which will limit the computations and the memory to the tiles specified in the `layout`:

```python
import torch
from xformers.components.attention import BlockSparseAttention
BLOCK_SIZE = 32     # for instance
SEQ = 1024          # ..
layout = torch.tril(torch.ones(SEQ//BLOCK_SIZE, SEQ//BLOCK_SIZE)).cuda()  # Only compute the lower triangular
lower_tril_attention = BlockSparseAttention(layout=layout, block_size=BLOCK_SIZE, dropout=0.1)
causal_mask = torch.tril(torch.ones(SEQ, SEQ)).bool().cuda()
...
att = lower_tril_attention(k, q, v, att_mask=causal_mask)
```

## Extend the xFormers parts zoo locally

This can be done in a private fork of xFormers, if this is a work in progress or not something that you would like to share at this point, or directly in xFormers in order to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/fairinternal/xformers/pulls).

We follow a register-based architecture, which is practical for unit testing, and loose inheritance (not all blocks expose the exact same interface). Let's consider for instance the [Nystrom-based attention mechanism](xformers/components/attention/nystrom.py)

```python
@dataclass
class NystromSelfAttentionConfig(AttentionConfig):
    ...

@register_attention("nystrom", NystromSelfAttentionConfig)
class NystromAttention(Attention):
    def __init__(
        self,
        dropout: float,
        num_heads: int,
        num_landmarks: int = 64,
        landmark_pooling: Optional[nn.Module] = None,
        causal: bool = False,
        use_razavi_pinverse: bool = True,
        pinverse_original_init: bool = False,
        inv_iterations: int = 6,  # recommended default in paper was 6.
        v_skip_connection: Optional[nn.Module] = None,
        conv_kernel_size: Optional[int] = None,
        *args,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        ...


    def forward(
        self, q: torch.Tensor, k: torch.Tensor, v: torch.Tensor, *args, **kwargs
    ):
        ...
```

There are a couple of things to remark, which would be true of any other extension. This also applies to the other components in xformers:

- The attention mechanism inherits from the base component
- We define a configuration for this block, which is not explicitly used in the constructor, but is required if you want to register this block
- The construction needs to accept extra `*args, **kwargs` arguments, so that the same configuration can be used by different blocks, even if not all fields are useful
- The registration is done with the following snippet, which both registers this attention with a given name, and ties a configuration to it. The same would apply to the other component types.

```python
@register_attention("nystrom", NystromSelfAttentionConfig)
class NystromAttention(Attention):
...
```

Doing this opens up at least three tools in the xFormers toolbox:

- the relevant unit tests will now automatically pick up this new variant. You can call all of them in one go with

```python
pytest -x -k my_component_name
```

- if applicable (attention mechanism), the attention benchmark will pick up this new variant automatically
- the [LRA benchmarks](xformers/benchmarks/LRA/README.md)) will pick up this new block option. You can define a [config](xformers/benchmarks/LRA/code/config.json) with your new part and trigger LRA jobs. As a reminder (more information in the dedicated README) you can trigger a LRA job locally with

```bash
python3 run_tasks.py --attention <your attention name> --task <task> --config <config_path> --world_size N
```

or even submit a batch of jobs to a SLURM enabled cluster with

```bash
python3 batch_submit.py -c code/config.json -ck <your checkpoing and log path> -a <your attention name>
```

## Contributing an extension to the xFormers repository

Here are a couple of additional guidelines which should make it easier to add a new block variant to this repo:

- Default values need to be defined in the class constructor, not in the config.
  - Using the config objects is optional, people should feel free to cherry pick the blocks as is
  - Prevent duplication or colliding definitions
  - Make sure that the configurations are composable, in that a subset of the configs is enough to instantiate all the blocks with reasonable settings. The unit tests will check this for you
- Fields which have default values in the block constructor should be typed as `Optional[Type]`
- Please follow the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to make sure that formatting and linting is checked
- Just define the (pure pytorch) constructor and forward call typically, no need to handle anything specific to this repo (except for inheritance)
- No need to change unit tests or benchmarks, the new variant will be automatically picked up

That's it, and thank you !

## Per component cherry picking

### I'm only interested in testing out the attention mechanisms that are hosted here

That's completely fine ! There are two paths into doing this:

- Either you import the attention mechanisms that you're interested in directly in your code base, their API should be very similar and you would own everything. The dimension expectations are explained in [Understand the dimension conventions](#understand-the-dimension-conventions).

```python
import torch
from xformers.components.attention import ScaledDotProduct

attention = ScaledDotProduct().cuda()
inputs = torch.rand((16, 1024, 1024), device=torch.device("cuda"))
mask = (torch.rand((1024, 1024)) < 0.9).cuda()
self_attention = attention(q=inputs, k=inputs, v=inputs, mask=mask)
```

Any of the other attention mechanisms can be instantiated and called in a similar way.

- Alternatively, a `build_attention` helper is provided, which takes a dict as an input. In that case, you defer a lot of the instantiation work to xFormers, which makes it a little more obscure although the parameters are hopefully straightforward. This was initially built for internal use in xFormers, to make sure that we can programatically build and test all possible combinations. In turn this should allow you to do sweeps or architecture search, given that the multihead attention definition becomes something like:

```python
  from xformers.components import MultiHeadDispatch, build_attention
  SEQ = 1024
  MODEL = 384
  HEADS = 16
  DROPOUT = 0.1

  my_config = {
      "name": attention_name,  # you can easily make this dependent on a file, sweep,..
      "dropout": DROPOUT,
      "seq_len": SEQ,
      "attention_query_mask": torch.rand((SEQ, 1)) < 0.3, # some dummy mask
  }

  attention = build_attention(my_config)

  # build a multi head dispatch to test this attention mechanism
  multi_head = MultiHeadDispatch(
      seq_len=SEQ,
      dim_model=MODEL,
      residual_dropout=DROPOUT,
      num_heads=HEADS,
      attention=attention,
  ).to(device)

  # do something with my new multi-head attention
  #...
```

Please note that this approach is not restricted to the attention, you can always import directly and work with `xformers.components.MultiHeadDispatch`, or `xformers.components.feedforward.FusedMLP`, or even `xformers.factory.xFormerEncoderBlock`.

### I'm used to PyTorch Transformer Encoder, do you have an equivalent ?

PyTorch already exposes a couple of pure Transformer blocks, for instance TransformerEncoder and [TransformerEncoderLayer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer.html?highlight=encoder#torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer).
Their interfaces are :

```python
TransformerEncoderLayer(
    d_model,
    nhead,
    dim_feedforward=2048,
    dropout=0.1,
    activation='relu',
    layer_norm_eps=1e-05,
    batch_first=False,
    device=None,
    dtype=None
    ):
    ...

Transformer(
    d_model=512,
    nhead=8,
    num_encoder_layers=6,
    num_decoder_layers=6,
    dim_feedforward=2048,
    dropout=0.1,
    activation='relu',
    custom_encoder=None,
    custom_decoder=None,
    layer_norm_eps=1e-05,
    batch_first=False,
    device=None,
    dtype=None):
    .
```

We don't have the exact same interfaces, but we have something fairly close with the [model_factory](xformers/factory/model_factory.py).

It’s worth noting that xFormer’s blocks expect tensors to be batch first, while Pytorch’s transformers uses a sequence first convention. Don’t forget to permute if you use xFormers’s blocks as drop-in replacements.

Similarly, the attention masks conventions are different: in Pytorch, the mask is *True* when an element should *not* be attended to, whereas in xFormer it’s the opposite. Don’t forget to negate your attention masks to use xFormers’ blocks as drop-in replacements.

The equivalent with xFormers would look like the following. You can think of it  as a declaration of the sequence of blocks that you would like instantiated.

```python
from xformers.factory.model_factory import xFormer, xFormerConfig

my_config =  [
    # A list of the encoder or decoder blocks which constitute the Transformer.
    # Note that a sequence of different encoder blocks can be used, same for decoders
    {
        "reversible": False,  # Optionally make these layers reversible, to save memory
        "block_config": {
            "block_type": "encoder",
            "num_layers": 3,  # Optional, this means that this config will repeat N times
            "dim_model": 384,
            "layer_norm_style": "pre",  # Optional, pre/post
            "position_encoding_config": {
                "name": "vocab",  # whatever position encodinhg makes sense
                "dim_model": 384,
                "seq_len": 1024,
                "vocab_size": 64,
            },
            "multi_head_config": {
                "num_heads": 4,
                "dim_model": 384,
                "residual_dropout": 0,
                "attention": {
                    "name": "linformer", # whatever attention mechanism
                    "dropout": 0,
                    "causal": True,
                    "seq_len": 512,
                },
            },
            "feedforward_config": {
                "name": "MLP",
                "dim_model": 384,
                "dropout": 0,
                "activation": "relu",
                "hidden_layer_multiplier": 4,
            },
        }
    }
]

config = xFormerConfig(**my_config)  # This part of xFormers is entirely type checked and needs a config object, could be changed in the fututure
model = xFormer.from_config(config).to(device)
```

Note that this exposes a couple more knobs than the PyTorch Transformer interface, but in turn is probably a little more flexible. There are a couple of repeated settings here (dimensions mostly), this is taken care of in the [LRA benchmarking config](benchmarks/LRA/code/config.json)

## Reversible block

### Intro

This block applies to residual paths, and was first proposed by [Gomez et al.][1]. Its application in the Transformer context was first proposed in the [Reformer][2] paper, and is largely unrelated to the other proposals from this paper (LSH and chunked MLP processing).

We use and very lightly adapt the implementation by [Robin Bruegger](https://github.com/RobinBruegger/RevTorch/blob/master/revtorch/revtorch.py) and some blocks from [LucidRains](https://github.com/lucidrains/reformer-pytorch/blob/master/reformer_pytorch/reversible.py).

A reversible layer requires two inputs (x1, x2) and produces two outputs (y1, y2) via two functions F and G, following the relations:

```python
y1 = x1 + F(x2)
y2 = x2 + G(y1)
```

In turn, this means that (x1, x2) can be recovered from (y1, y2) (see [1] for details)

```python
x2 = y2 - G(y1)  # Note that another FW-like pass is needed
x1 = y1 - F(x2)
```

The effect is comparable to activation checkpointing, in that it opens up for a tradeoff in between GPU memory and compute. One benefit is that no extra wrap is needed, all the residual paths can be naturally checkpointed. In a distributed setting, freeing up GPU memory can help using less GPUs, and the saved communication cost can more than make up for the extra compute.

### Transformer

Considering the multi-head attention and feedforward blocks (including the residual paths), one can set F as MHA (+ layer norm) and G as Feedforward (+ layer norm) and get to something very close (but not exactly the same) to the original Transformer formulation from [Vaswani et al.][3], as follows

```python
y1 = x1 + MHA(x2)
y2 = x2 + Feedforward(y1)
```

A difference is that the residual path in the Feedforward deals with the original input, and not the MHA output, but in practice if `dim(x1) == dim(x2) == dim(model)`, the accuracy should not be affected, as verified in [2] and in xFormers.

### In practice

This repository exposes two main helpers in `xformers.components.reversible`: ReversibleBlock and ReversibleSequence. `ReversibleBlock` will take `f` and `g` as defined above, and `ReversibleSequence` can combine them sequentially, similarly to `torch.nn.ModuleList`.

```python
class ReversibleBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, f: nn.Module, g: nn.Module):
        ...

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor, f_args={}, g_args={}):
        ...


class ReversibleSequence(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, blocks: nn.ModuleList):
        ...

    def forward(self, x, arg_route=(True, False), **kwargs):
        """
        arg_route: whether to route the kwargs to f and g
        """
        ...

```

Reversible layers are also exposed as a boolean option in when building complete xFormers (which is optional), as defined in `xformers.factory.model_factory`. Please note that the reversible layer is not yet compatible with the use of multiple forward passes and DDP.

```python
class xFormerStackConfig:
    block_config: Union[xFormerEncoderConfig, xFormerDecoderConfig]
    num_layers: int
    reversible: bool  # the sequence of layers becomes reversible
```
